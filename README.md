# 🏡 Real Estate Price Prediction - Mumbai Region

This project focuses on predicting real estate prices in Mumbai using data sourced from **99acres.com**. After performing thorough data cleaning and transformation, multiple regression models were implemented and evaluated to find the best predictor.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

* **Source**: 99acres.com (scraped data)
* **Region**: Mumbai
* **Columns**:

  * `Region`: Regional code
  * `Property_Age`: Age of the property
  * `Area_Type`: Categorical variable (encoded)
  * `Area_SqFt`: Total area in square feet
  * `Rate_SqFt`: Rate per square foot
  * `Floor_No`: Floor number
  * `Bedroom`: Number of bedrooms
  * `Price_Lakh`: Target variable (property price in lakhs)

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing & Cleaning

* Handled missing values
* Encoded categorical variables (like `Area_Type`)
* Removed outliers using IQR and z-score
* Converted all units to a consistent format
* Standardized and normalized numerical features where necessary

## 🧠 Models Used

Three models were implemented and compared:

1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Random Forest Regressor**
3. **XGBoost Regressor**

## 🏆 Results

* **XGBoost Regressor** gave the best performance with:

  * **R² Score**: **98.4%**
  * Very low RMSE and MAE on test data

## 📚 Libraries & Tools

* `Pandas`, `NumPy` for data manipulation
* `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` for data visualization
* `Scikit-learn` for ML models & evaluation
* `XGBoost` for gradient boosting
* `Jupyter Notebook` / `Google Colab` for development

## 📈 Future Improvements

* Deploy the best model using Streamlit or Flask
* Add support for real-time price prediction
* Incorporate more features like locality, amenities, etc.
* Build a map-based visual explorer using Folium or Plotly
